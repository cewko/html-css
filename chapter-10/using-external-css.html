<!-- 
The <link> element in HTML is used within the <head> to link a CSS file for styling the page. 
It is an empty element, so it doesn't require a closing tag. It typically uses three attributes:

- href: Specifies the path to the CSS file.
- type: Indicates the type of document, usually "text/css".
- rel: Defines the relationship, set to "stylesheet" for CSS files.

Multiple CSS files can be linked by using multiple <link> elements. 
For instance, one file may handle fonts and colors, while another controls layout.
